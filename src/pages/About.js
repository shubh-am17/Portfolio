        I'm on the lookout for internship opportunities, full-time roles, or
        exciting freelance projects. ðŸš€ I thrive on challenges and have honed my
        skills not just in the classroom but also on platforms like LeetCode,
        where I tackle Data Structures and Algorithms questions. The thrill of
        coding contests? I'm in! ðŸ’» My journey in tech has equipped me with a
        solid foundation, and I'm eager to contribute my skills to real-world
        projects. Let's build something amazing together{" "}
